grepTest.txt:One of the most important community feedback channels is together.jolla.com and your votes on topics do really count. For example, last year we made 4 Sailfish OS releases and fixed over 100 items you reported in together.jolla.com, benefiting all Sailfish users. Thank you for your valuable reports!
grepTest.txt:We want to make Sailfish available to as many people as possible in as many markets as possible. However, for a relatively small company like Jolla, there are markets that are easier to enter while some are more difficult. In some cases the legislation or competitive landscape makes entering difficult for us even if there is demand. We’ve been studying the markets carefully and we’ve selected handful of markets for our next expansions. These are markets where there is clearly demand and opportunity, and the business environment is suitable for us.
grepTest.txt:We’ve been really happy with Sailfish X, but this year is going to be an even more exciting year for Sailfish X and the Jolla crew and we can’t wait for all of you to see and experience all the improvements that are cooking up.
