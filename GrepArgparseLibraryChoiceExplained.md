First I went to popular and active [Awesome Kotlin](https://github.com/KotlinBy/awesome-kotlin)
GitHub repository, where one can find information about decent 
libraries for Kotlin and searched for libraries for CLI argument parsing.

I got three results and compared them.
As a result I got the following table ("best" in each column would be check-marked):

library                       | popularity (stars + forks) | commits | last commit date) | license     
------------------------------|----------------------------|---------|-------------------|-------------
[leprosus/kotlin-cli](https://github.com/leprosus/kotlin-cli)           |   29+10                    |   34    | ✓ Feb 4 2018      | ✓ MIT       
[jimschubert/kopper](https://github.com/jimschubert/kopper)            |   37+2                     |   24    |   Dec 31 2016     | ✓ MIT       
[xenomachina/kotlin-argparser](https://github.com/xenomachina/kotlin-argparser)  | ✓ 213+18                   | ✓ 211   |   Jan 19 2018     | ✓ LGPL-2.1  

From there the choice was quite obvious, but I decided to look at usage examples for each library (table order preserved):
- option names are mapped to options using getters for option names in the parser class, standard features (defaults, descriptions...), limited casting possibilities (cannot read option and get its value as arbitrary class instance) 
- mapping using delegate properties, standard features, limited casting
- mapping using delegates, standard features, ability to map parsed argument

The last one seemed to be the most convenient one, which just concluded previous decision.

In other words, I decided to use xenomachina/kotlin-argparser.
